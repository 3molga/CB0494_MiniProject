# CB0494 HDB Resale Price Prediction Project

This repository stores a Jupyter Notebook file used for the HDB resale price prediction mini-project in CB0494: Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. The .csv file containing the dataset used is also included.

## Procedure
1. Exploratory analysis of the dataset to investigate which variables were most predictive of resale price.
2. Separating the dataset by the "town" variable, and keeping all other numeric variables.
3. Training linear regression models for each dataset.
4. Evaluating the performance of the linear regression models with test datasets.
5. Utilizing the linear regression models to create a visual that displays if a prospective buyer can afford their desired HDB resale flat.
